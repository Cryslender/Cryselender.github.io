## About Me
I am a highly motivated and detail-oriented aspiring software developer with a strong passion for coding and problem-solving. I hold a Bachelor of Science Honours in Computer Science and Information Technology from North-West University, which I completed in 2023. I am eager to contribute to innovative projects and gain hands-on experience in a dynamic team environment.

My technical skills include proficiency in languages such as Java, Python, C++, C#, and web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js. I also have experience with RESTful APIs, version control using Git, and a solid understanding of data structures and algorithms. I have worked on various projects, including the development of a classification model to analyze Twitter comments, predictive models, and applications in areas like fraud detection and automated car navigation.

Currently, I am working as an IT Technician/Support at Nketoane Municipality, where I continue to develop my technical and problem-solving abilities in a practical setting. I thrive in collaborative environments and bring excellent communication, time management, and analytical skills to any team I work with.
